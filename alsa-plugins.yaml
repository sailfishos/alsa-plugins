      Description: |
          This plugin allows any program that uses the ALSA API to access a PulseAudio
          sound daemon. In other words, native ALSA applications can play and record
          sound across a network. There are two plugins in the suite, one for PCM and
          one for mixer control.
      Requires:
          - pulseaudio
